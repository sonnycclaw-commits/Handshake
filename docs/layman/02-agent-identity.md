# What is an Agent Identity?

An agent identity is the backend record that answers:
1. **Who is this agent?**
2. **Who does it act for?**
3. **What is it allowed to do?**

## In plain terms
Agent identity is the agent's work badge.

A good badge includes:
- Agent ID (unique name)
- Owner principal (human/org)
- Tenant/workspace boundary
- Roles and scopes
- Policy profile (limits)
- HITL threshold (when approval is required)

## Why it matters
Without a strong identity record:
- permissions drift,
- cross-tenant mistakes happen,
- approvals become inconsistent,
- and audits become weak.

With it, every action can be traced to a specific agent and authority chain.
