# What Handshake Backend Can Do (Now / Next / Later)

## Now (available)
- Workflow request + decision-room + decision action + evidence timeline
- Policy simulate + apply with trust-boundary checks
- Metrics summary/series/reasons
- Agent and entity read rails
- Scope enforcement (`self|tenant|any`) with tenant isolation
- CI safety gates (schema/env/invariants/release/watch)

## Next (integration phase)
- Frontend flow polish and UX-level error handling
- Threshold tuning from real usage data
- Incident drill automation and operator feedback loops

## Later (aspirational)
- Rich trust posture surfaces
- Policy impact planning UX
- Stronger trust portability across agent ecosystems

## Bottom line
Backend is ready for frontend integration and live behavior testing.
