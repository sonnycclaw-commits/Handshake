# What is Handshake? (Plain English)

Handshake is the **safety and authorization layer** between an AI agent and real-world actions.

## Simple version
If an agent is like an intern, Handshake is the system that gives it:
- clear limits,
- approval boundaries,
- and a full activity record.

## Why it exists
Without Handshake, agents either:
- get too much access (unsafe), or
- need constant manual approvals (too slow).

Handshake enables **bounded autonomy**:
- agents can act within rules,
- humans step in at higher risk,
- everything is auditable.

## What Handshake does
- Verifies identity and permissions
- Applies policy limits (scope, spend, timing, risk)
- Enforces human approval at boundaries (HITL)
- Logs decision + action evidence
- Returns safe, structured errors when blocked

## What Handshake is not
- Not a vault that stores your secrets
- Not a dashboard UI
- Not an autonomous decision-maker by itself

It is the **trust rail** that makes agent action legible and controllable.
