# Handshake Thesis & Assumptions (Early-Stage, Informal)

Date: 2026-02-28
Status: Working draft (informal)

## Core Thesis

Handshake becomes the trust layer for the agentic economy **if it is the fastest way to convert autonomous agent capability into bounded, legible, revocable action at scale.**

---

## What Must Be True

1. **Agent action volume outpaces human oversight**  
   Market needs delegation infrastructure, not more manual control panels.

2. **Trust primitives become mandatory rails**  
   Identity, authority, audit, and revocation become baseline requirements for serious agent deployment.

3. **Blast-radius framing wins**  
   Buyers care more about downside containment than abstract autonomy claims.

4. **Interoperability beats closed stacks**  
   Handshake must sit across ecosystems/protocols, not depend on one platform winner.

5. **Onboarding proves trust in <5 minutes**  
   Users see immediate control + visibility; otherwise adoption stalls.

6. **Machine-readable policy actually governs behavior**  
   If agents can’t parse/obey boundaries, trust layer is performative.

7. **Audit trails are decision-grade**  
   Post-incident accountability must be clear, attributable, and exportable.

8. **Revocation is instant and reliable**  
   If you can’t stop an agent quickly, no institution will trust it.

9. **Decision fatigue is managed**  
   System escalates only meaningful exceptions, not every action.

10. **Early wedge creates compounding trust artifacts**  
    Initial use case must generate reusable proofs that improve cross-agent trust over time.

## Key Assumptions to Test Aggressively

- Enterprises will adopt bounded autonomy before full autonomy.
- Counterparties will prefer agents with verifiable trust metadata.
- Policy + audit overhead won’t kill agent performance/UX.
- Trust portability can become a network effect.
- Regulatory pressure will favor explicit accountability rails.

---

## Working Interpretation

If these hold, Handshake is infrastructure.  
If they don’t, Handshake is a feature.

## Notes

This is intentionally informal and high-level.
Next iteration can translate each assumption into explicit tests, metrics, and falsification criteria.
